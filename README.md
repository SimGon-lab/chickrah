Hi! My name is Simone Gonzalez and this is my first game! I have used Unity to create a world where a chick just wants coffee but has to go through quite a few obstacles to get it....

I want to make my first game, Chickrah, better.  I want to add villains that will make it harder to beat the game (they can move around and try to catch the chick).  I want to add some kind of final boss level.  My brother has drawn up some characters I can use (as in the final folder).

For now, the game has 3 basic levels.  I could refine these levels and add tiles or redo them and add the villain characters that will cause the player to lose a life when it touches these characters.
